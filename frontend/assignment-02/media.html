<p><strong>Image 1:</strong> This was taken when I attended the Wecode conference. The experience inspired me to create a LinkedIn profile and taught me to never be shy about pursuing my goals. If you really want something, go aheadâ€”it's okay not to know everything at first. The right mindset and strong work ethic will take you a long way.</p>

<p>Welcome to the beginning of an amazing journey, this is where it all starts.</p>
<p>On this page, you'll find information about me, my interests, and the path I've taken so far.</p>
<p>I'll be sharing pictures and a video so you can get a better sense of who I am ðŸ˜Š</p>
