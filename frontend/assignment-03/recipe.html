    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
            <li>Bloom the yeast - In a small bowl, combine lukewarm water, yeast, and 1 tsp sugar. Let sit for 10 minutes until foamy.<br>
            <u>Why:</u> <i>This activates the yeast, ensuring it's alive and ready to make the bread rise.</i></li>
            <li>Mix dry ingredients - In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt.<br>
            <u>Why:</u> <i>Evenly mixing the dry ingredients ensures consistent flavor and texture.</i></li>
            <li>Add wet ingredients - Pour in the milk, eggs, and bloomed yeast mixture. Mix with a stand mixer until combined.<br>
            <u>Why:</u> <i>Using a mixer ensures a smooth, lump-free dough and evenly distributes ingredients.</i></li>
            <li>Add butter/margarine - Mix in the butter and knead with the mixer for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.<br>
            <u>Why:</u> <i>Kneading develops gluten for structure, while butter makes the bread soft and flavorful.</i></li>
            <li>First rise - Remove dough from the bowl, dust the kneading surface with flour, then lightly oil the bowl. Place the dough back, cover, and let rise for 1 hour 30 minutes.<br>
            <u>Why:</u> <i>The first rise allows the dough to double in size, developing flavor and texture.</i></li>
            <li>Shape the dough - Punch down to release air, dust with flour, divide in half, and roll each piece into a rectangle. Place in greased loaf pans.<br>
            <u>Why:</u> <i>Rolling creates an even crumb, and shaping before the second rise ensures the loaf structure.</i></li>
            <li>Second rise - Cover pans and let dough rise for 1 hour until puffy.<br>
            <u>Why:</u> <i>This final proofing creates a light, airy texture.</i></li>
            <li>Egg wash - Brush tops with beaten egg.<br>
            <u>Why:</u> <i>The egg wash gives the bread a glossy, golden finish.</i></li>
            <li>Bake - Preheat oven to 350Â°F and bake for 25-30 minutes until golden and hollow-sounding when tapped.<br>
            <u>Why:</u> <i>Proper temperature ensures even baking and prevents a doughy center.</i></li>
            <li>Cool and serve - Remove from pans and let cool on a wire rack before slicing.<br>
            <u>Why:</u> <i>Cooling prevents the bread from becoming gummy and helps slices hold shape.</i></li>
        </ul>
