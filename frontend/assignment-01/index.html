    <h2 id="why-alt-school">Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>

    <p>You might be wondering why I’d join AltSchool while already studying Computer Science. Here’s why:</p>

    <p>
        I’m someone who constantly seeks to improve. While I’m learning a lot, I needed a place that focuses not just on theory but also on building real-world skills. AltSchool gives me just that — a space to grow, collaborate, and thrive.
    </p>

    <p>I joined for these reasons:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>To overcome imposter syndrome and truly become skillful</li>
        <li>To master my craft and grow into a better programmer</li>
        <li>To connect with passionate learners around the world</li>
        <li>To build projects and break into the tech industry</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        AltSchool matches the kind of environment I want to learn in — one built on collaboration, community, and continuous growth. Through learning circles and hands-on experience, I believe I’m exactly where I need to be.
